# TODO

- redo app - don't even to dynamic routes, do static pages (so you can getStaticProps the highlighted code
  - how to pass props
  - <Code /> should take highlighted code
  - because the highlight.js won't render with color!
  - THIS IS THE CORE ISSUE: FIX !<https://github.com/vercel/next.js/discussions/36407>
  - be smart - preview deploying the code change (if possible, but the refactor is "necessary")
  - can now read snippets from directory and pass them in in serverSide! (should be props)
